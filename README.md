# Essential
A treatise on essentialism and the nature of things. 

## Introduction
The philosophical definition of *essence* in this praxis is taken as the ontological and idempotent entity that preceeds epistemological truth values of experiences obtained by an existing cognitive being. In this sense, essence is a constituent of the cognitive being that affords the potential for cognition as well as existence simultaneously. This essence has no further parts and is foundational. It ontologically preceeds the concepts of observability and controlability. As such the word "essence" refers to the essence of existence and it is posited here that the very nature of existence includes a conscience that imparts potential for cognition. 

> `Conscience is the essence of mere existence and mere existence is the essence conscience.` 

The aim of this philosophical work is to accurately and precisely negotiate difficult questions like, "what is essential labour and who is an essential worker?" with closure. 

The leap from a definition of an immutable, idempotent essence that happens to be an intangible and nearly ineffable component of all existant entities to the definitions of mutable entities is explored via the following system of epistemology:

  - Systems Perspective
  - Logic and Logical Precepts
  - Extension of Axiomatic Set Theory
  - Current Models of Cosmos
  - Defining Life and Species
  - Distinguishing Human Beings
  - Design of Societies or Organizations
  - Design of Currency

## Systems Perspective
The word "being" is taken as a synonym for the word "system" and the definition of the word *word* is provided after a discussion on the concept of concept and the concept of recursion.

A system is a collection of entities where the word "entity" is a synonym for the words "thing" and "concept". As such the words - being, system, entity and thing are synonymous within this discourse. Furthermore, a "property" or an "attribute" is an entity that happens to be mutable.

The appropriate deffinition of mutability or changability is discussed after a discussion of "entropy" and "degrees of freedom" so for now, let the sense of such words be the putative definitions available in any English dictionary. 

Let *symantic space* allude to the collection of all concepts that are knowable and unknowable to a system of maximum cognitive potency. As a philosophical tenant, the existence of the symantic space is decidedly independent of the cognitive system. It is already implied that there exist degrees of cognition and that a cognitive system may achieve the complete absence of cognition to become non-existent or anhialated. 

### Presence and Absence
In discussing what is versus what isn't the implicit assumption of dichotomies is utilized. In explicating such assumptions we can achieve a potential for "checking our assumptions" at any juncture in this version controlled document. 

TODO: continue discussion on logical monads, dichotomies, trichotomies etc.
