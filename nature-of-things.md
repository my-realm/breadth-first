## Essential
A treatise on *essentialism* and the nature of things. 

### Introduction
> *In the beginning there was a story about a story.*

The philosophical definition of *essence* in this praxis is taken as the ontological and idempotent entity that precedes epistemological truth values of experiences obtained by an existing cognitive being. In this sense, essence is a constituent of the cognitive being that simultaneously affords the potential for cognition, as well as existence. This essence has no further parts and is foundational. It ontologically precedes the concepts of observability and controllability. As such, the word "essence" refers to the basis of existence, and thus, it is posited here that the very nature of existence includes a conscience which, by itself, imparts a potential for cognition to the existent being. 

> **Conscience is the essence of existence and existence is the essence of conscience.**

The aim of this philosophical work is to accurately and precisely negotiate difficult questions like, "What is essential labor and who is an essential worker?" with closure. 

The leap from a definition of a cognitive being, which relies on the idea of an immutable, idempotent essence that can in itself be an intangible and nearly ineffable component of all existent entities, to the definitions of mutable entities that can evolve, is explored via the following system of epistemology:

  - Systems Perspective
  - Logic and Logical Precepts
  - Extension of Axiomatic Set Theory
  - Current Models of Cosmos
  - Defining Life and Species
  - Distinguishing Human Beings
  - Design of Societies or Organizations
  - Design of Currency

### Systems Perspective
Here, the word "being" is taken as a synonym for the word "physical thing" or "system." And the definition of the word *word* is to be provided after a discussion on the concept of concept, and the concept of recursion.[^1] 

A system is a collection of entities where the word "entity" alludes to any tangible or intangible part of a cognizer's "reality." As such the words - being, system, entity and thing are synonymous within this discourse. Furthermore, a "property" or an "attribute" of an entity is a thing, that happens to be mutable.

The appropriate definition of "mutability" or "changeability" is discussed after a discussion of "entropy" and "degrees of freedom" so for now, let the sense of such words like mutability be the putative definitions available in any English dictionary. 

Let *semantic space* allude to the collection of all concepts that are knowable and unknowable to a system, a system that presumably has greatest possible cognitive potency in the universe. As a philosophical tenant, the existence of the universe's semantic space is decidedly independent of every humanoid cognitive system. This means that the universe and "its mind" are not contingent on the form and function of any human being or any computer based "artificial intelligence." This also implies that certain functions do exist within the universe, like death, that can allow a being to achieve the complete absence of cognition, to then become non-existent or annihilated. 

### Presence and Absence
In discussing what is versus what isn't "real," the implicit assumption of dichotomies is utilized. In explicating such assumptions we can gain the ability to "check our assumptions", as we continue on this journey. 

TODO: continue discussion on logical monad, dichotomies, trichotomies etc.
